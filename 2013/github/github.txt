Forking makes my version of the project more isolated from the original one because I don't have to be on the collaborators list of the original project

You cannot always make a branch or pull an existing branch and push back to it, because you are not registered as a collaborator for that specific project.

se the following commands to add the 'upsteam' (original project location) as a remote branch so that you can get their updates into your branch

svn checkout
When you are cloning a GitHub repo on your local workstation, you cannot contribute back to the upstream repo unless you are explicitly declared as "contributor".
So that clone (to your local workstation) isn't a "fork". It is just a clone.
Download zip: just local copy
Clone: serve as local repository with all original commit information

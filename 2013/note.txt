I know this is trivial, but I can't seem to get it to work and I can't
find a good example.  I have a list of files, A1, A2,...An, that I need to
concatenate (stack).  Since there are hundreds of files, It would be best
to write a macro to generate the list.  All the examples I saw were to
pipe a list of filenames which I can't do since I have other files in the
directory.  Since I know the value of n, it seems like I could do
something like:

%macro list;
  %do i = 1 %to 100;
  %let lst=[some kind of array containing the file names];
  %end;
%mend list;

Not exactly sure how to code.  Help appreciated.


DONOT PICNIC!


Forking makes my version of the project more isolated from the original one because I don't have to be on the collaborators list of the original project

You cannot always make a branch or pull an existing branch and push back to it, because you are not registered as a collaborator for that specific project.

se the following commands to add the 'upsteam' (original project location) as a remote branch so that you can get their updates into your branch


Forking is nothing more than a clone on the GitHub server side:


The intended English sense of 'fork' here is the sense in which a road or river splits from one into two, which may then diverge and have different destinations (called a fork presumably because of the visual similarity to a two-tine fork, like an old agricultural fork


svn checkout
When you are cloning a GitHub repo on your local workstation, you cannot contribute back to the upstream repo unless you are explicitly declared as "contributor".
So that clone (to your local workstation) isn't a "fork". It is just a clone.
Download zip: just local copy
Clone: serve as local repository with all original commit information
